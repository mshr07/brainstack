### 3. Advanced Wait Strategies
- Custom wait conditions
- Race conditions
- Parallel waiting
- Polling mechanisms

### 4. Network Testing
- Request/response interception
- API mocking
- Network condition simulation
- WebSocket handling

### 5. Multi-Context Testing
- Isolated browser sessions
- Cross-tab communication
- Shared authentication
- Concurrent operations

## Test Execution Tips

### Environment Setup
Ensure you have the following installed:
```bash
npm install @playwright/test
npx playwright install
```

### Running Subsets of Tests
```bash
# Run only tests containing "timeout"
npx playwright test --grep timeout

# Run tests excluding "slow" ones
npx playwright test --grep-invert slow

# Run tests in a specific describe block
npx playwright test --grep "Network Delays"
```

### Parallel Execution
```bash
# Run tests in parallel (default behavior)
npx playwright test

# Run tests serially
npx playwright test --workers=1
```

### Test Results
After running tests, check:
- `test-results/` directory for artifacts
- HTML report: `npx playwright show-report`
- Summary file: `test-results/summary.json`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Timeouts**: Increase timeout values in playwright.config.js
2. **Network failures**: Check internet connection and test site availability
3. **Browser installation**: Run `npx playwright install`
4. **Permissions**: Ensure proper file/directory permissions

### Debug Mode
Use debug mode to step through tests:
```bash
npx playwright test --debug --headed
```

### Verbose Output
For detailed logging:
```bash
npx playwright test --verbose
```

## Extending the Test Suite

### Adding New Tests
1. Create new `.spec.js` files in the `tests/` directory
2. Follow the naming convention: `feature-name.spec.js`
3. Use the existing test patterns as templates

### Custom Wait Methods
See `wait-methods.spec.js` for examples of implementing custom wait logic and retry mechanisms.

### Network Mocking
Refer to `network-commands.spec.js` for advanced network interception and mocking patterns.

This test suite provides a comprehensive foundation for testing modern web applications with various network conditions, loading scenarios, and browser behaviors.
